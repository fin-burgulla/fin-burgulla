## About me

I study Computer Science and Mathematics at Georgetown University. I build end-to-end products that move from idea to user impact. Recent work includes a L’Oréal branded AI chatbot on Cloudflare Workers, a NASA APOD gallery, a JavaScript game, a UX refresh for a student credit union that lifted engagement by 10 percent, and data analytics projects that turn raw data into decisions. I enjoy shipping fast, measuring honestly, and iterating with teams.

## What I am working on

* Front end craft with React and modern JavaScript  
* AI tooling that pairs clear prompts with strong guardrails  
* Data analysis that prefers decisions over dashboards
